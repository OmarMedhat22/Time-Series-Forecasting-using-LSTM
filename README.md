# Time-Series-Forecasting-using-LSTM
Time Series Forecasting using LSTM


This project is part from Sequences, Time Series and Prediction course by deeplearning.ai.

For more information see this [link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction)

## Definition
In this project LSTM Network is used to forecast time series data. the problem here is regression and the target of the model is to get the lowest MSE(mean square error). 



#### it will be easy to Run this project on colab
